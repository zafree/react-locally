## What’s in it?

- 🔥 `vite` as build tool. Its hot reloading and page refreshing in blessing fast.
- 👀 `react` as the view.
- 👮 `typescript` as catch types errors early in editor.
- 🧹 `eslint`, `eslint-airbnb-config` and `prettier` - combines performing code formatting. Stop worrying about code style consistency.
- 🖌️ `dart-sass` support - I extend it with CSS Modules.
- 🔀 `react-router-dom` v6 as the router.
